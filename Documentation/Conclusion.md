# Conclusion
## IoT Air & Noise Pollution Monitoring System

This project successfully demonstrates a low-cost and effective IoT-based solution for monitoring **air quality** and **noise levels** using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W. The system measures temperature, humidity, gas concentration, and sound intensity in real time, displays the values locally on an OLED screen, and uploads them to ThingSpeak for remote monitoring.

The results show that affordable sensors like MQ135 and MAX4466, when combined with cloud connectivity, can provide meaningful environmental insights. The buzzer alerts add an additional layer of safety by notifying users when temperature or air quality reaches unsafe levels.

Overall, the project achieves its goal of creating a simple, portable, and continuously updating environmental monitoring system suitable for homes, classrooms, and academic demonstrations.
