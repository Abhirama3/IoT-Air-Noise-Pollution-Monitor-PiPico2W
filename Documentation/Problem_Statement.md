# Problem Statement  
## IoT Air & Noise Pollution Monitoring System

Air and noise pollution have become major concerns in urban and semi-urban environments. Poor air quality can lead to respiratory illnesses, while excessive noise levels contribute to stress, hearing loss, and reduced productivity. Traditional monitoring systems are either expensive, lack portability, or do not provide real-time, remotely accessible data.

There is a need for a **low-cost, compact, and real-time IoT-based solution** that can continuously monitor environmental parameters such as:

- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Air quality  
- Noise levels  

and allow users to access these readings remotely through an IoT cloud platform.

This project aims to develop an **IoT Air & Noise Pollution Monitoring System** using the **Raspberry Pi Pico W**, capable of collecting environmental data, displaying it locally on an OLED, triggering alerts when thresholds are exceeded, and uploading readings to the cloud for real-time monitoring and analysis.

The system focuses on:

- **Accurate measurements** using affordable sensors  
- **Wireless connectivity** via Pico W  
- **Local + remote visualization** (OLED + ThingSpeak)  
- **Cost-effectiveness and ease of deployment**  
- **Scalability for indoor or outdoor use**  

This solution addresses the growing need for accessible environmental awareness and smart monitoring in homes, schools, workplaces, and smart-city applications.
